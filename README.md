# Data Warehousing Notes

A concise set of notes I created after watching two advanced YouTube tutorials by **Ansh Lamba**, covering Data Warehousing, Dimensional Data Modeling, ETL architecture, Incremental Loading, and SCD implementations.  
These notes are now part of my GitHub repository so I can revisit the concepts anytime and expand the collection as I continue learning. 🚀

## 📘 What I Watched

1. **[Data Warehouse – The Ultimate Guide [2025]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKcEyHF1U00&t=8939s)**
2. **[Data Modeling Masterclass for Data Engineers [2025]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7C1sWKQU-o)**

## 📂 GitHub

The full notes are available in this repository, and I will keep adding more resources and learning materials as I progress through my Data Engineering journey.
