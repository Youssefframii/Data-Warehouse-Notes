## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# Data Warehousing Notes

A concise set of notes I created after watching two advanced YouTube tutorials by **Ansh Lamba** and completing a portion of the **"Data Warehouse - The Ultimate Guide"** course on Udemy. These notes cover Data Warehousing, Dimensional Data Modeling, ETL architecture, Incremental Loading, and SCD implementations. All notes are now part of my GitHub repository so I can revisit the concepts anytime and expand my collection as I continue learning. 🚀
